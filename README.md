###  **ChatBox Lite: Offline Messaging Solution**

**Project Description**  
ChatBox Lite is a local, offline chat application built with React to provide messaging functionality even without an internet connection. Perfect for environments where internet access is limited or intermittent, ChatBox Lite enables peer-to-peer communication through a shared local network. Itâ€™s a fun project that focuses on basic networking concepts and offline data storage, making it a lightweight and accessible alternative to full-fledged messaging platforms.

**How to Use**  
Once the app is running, users within the same network can connect and begin chatting. Simply enter your name, and you'll be visible on the local chat room. Messages are delivered instantly to connected peers, and chat histories are saved locally, so conversations are available even after closing the app. This makes it easy to keep track of discussions without needing a constant internet connection.
